cd desktop/          				(change directory)
cd foldername						
git clone <copy link from github>			
git status					(check the status it shows you are on which branch)
git branch					(check branch)
git branch <branch name>  			(for new branch)
git checkout <branch name> 			(for switch branch)
git checkout -b <branch name> 			(switch branch from one to newly created branch)
git checkout -        				(switch to previous branch)
git checkout -d <branch name>     		(delete branch)
git add <any file example:.py file>		(it adds changes in working directory to the staging area)
git commit -m <file name>			(file finally branch me add ho jayegi)
						(use this is save all the changes that have been made locally and them to repository)
git push -u origin <branch name>		(Agar me new branch banata hu toh github per add krne ke leye push krte hai)
git pull origin <branch name>			(if I edit the file on github then want to pull the data on local)
